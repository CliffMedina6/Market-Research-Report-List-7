<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Buck-Boost Chip for Portable Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bidirectional</li><li>Unidirectional</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Buck-Boost chips are versatile power management devices used in portable power applications. In a unidirectional market, these chips regulate voltage to either step-down (buck) or step-up (boost) power levels, ensuring devices receive the correct voltage from a single power source. Conversely, the bidirectional market allows for both functions, enabling energy to be efficiently transferred in either direction. This flexibility supports applications such as battery management systems where energy needs to be delivered or replenished based on usage.</p></p>
