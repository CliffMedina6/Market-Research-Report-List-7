<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The B-Cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) Targeted Therapies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bispecific Antibodies</li><li>Antibody Drug Conjugates</li><li>Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells</li></ul></p>
<p><p>B-Cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) targeted therapies consist of various innovative treatment approaches for multiple myeloma. Bispecific antibodies engage two different antigens simultaneously, effectively redirecting immune cells to attack cancer cells. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine antibodies with cytotoxic drugs, delivering targeted therapy directly to BCMA-expressing tumor cells, minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) are genetically modified T-cells designed to recognize and kill BCMA-positive cancer cells, harnessing the body’s immune system for a more personalized treatment strategy.</p></p>
