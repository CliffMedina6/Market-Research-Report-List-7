<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Panel Detector (FPDs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect FPD</li><li>Direct FPD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flat Panel Detectors (FPDs) are advanced imaging devices used in radiology for capturing and converting X-ray images into digital formats. The market is divided into two primary types: Indirect FPDs and Direct FPDs. Indirect FPDs utilize a two-step process involving a scintillator to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then sensed by a photodetector. In contrast, Direct FPDs convert X-rays directly into electrical signals, offering improved efficiency and image quality, making them pivotal in modern medical imaging technologies.</p></p>
