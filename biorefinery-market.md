<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biorefinery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biochemical</li><li>Thermochemical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biorefinery market encompasses two primary types: biochemical and thermochemical. Biochemical biorefineries utilize biological processes, such as fermentation and enzymatic reactions, to convert biomass into valuable products like biofuels, chemicals, and bio-based materials. In contrast, thermochemical biorefineries employ high-temperature processes, such as pyrolysis and gasification, to break down organic materials, producing syngas and bio-oil, which can be further refined into fuels and chemicals. Both approaches aim to optimize resource utilization and promote sustainable practices.</p></p>
