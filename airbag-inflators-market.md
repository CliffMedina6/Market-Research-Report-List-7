<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airbag Inflators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflators</li><li>Stored Gas Inflators</li><li>Hybrid Inflators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airbag inflators market consists of three main types: pyrotechnic inflators, stored gas inflators, and hybrid inflators. Pyrotechnic inflators utilize combustion reactions to rapidly generate gas, effectively deploying the airbag in milliseconds. Stored gas inflators use compressed gases, such as nitrogen, which are released to fill the airbag instantly upon impact. Hybrid inflators combine both methods, offering the benefits of quick gas generation and reduced complexity in design. Each type addresses specific safety and performance requirements in automotive applications.</p></p>
