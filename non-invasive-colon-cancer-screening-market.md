<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non Invasive Colon Cancer Screening Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT)</li><li>Guaiac-based Fecal Occult Blood Test (gFOBT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-invasive colon cancer screening market primarily includes two types: the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) and the Guaiac-based Fecal Occult Blood Test (gFOBT). FIT detects blood in the stool using antibodies specific to human hemoglobin, offering higher specificity and requiring fewer dietary restrictions. In contrast, gFOBT identifies blood through a chemical reaction, but is less sensitive and demands more stringent dietary preparations. Both tests aid early detection of colorectal cancer, encouraging increased screening participation.</p></p>
