<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laryngeal Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hood Laryngeal Stent</li><li>Tubular Laryngeal Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The laryngeal stents market comprises two primary types: hood laryngeal stents and tubular laryngeal stents. Hood laryngeal stents are designed to cover the laryngeal area, providing a protective barrier while maintaining airway patency. They are often used in cases of severe laryngeal obstruction or trauma. Tubular laryngeal stents, on the other hand, maintain an open airway passage, making them suitable for airway management in various surgical procedures. Both types are crucial for ensuring patient safety during respiratory challenges.</p></p>
